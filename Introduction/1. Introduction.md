Let us start with an introduction to Data Structures. 

Data is an integral part of our application or programs. If we define a program, program is a set of instructions which performs operations on data to get some results.

# Introduction to Data Structures
## Data Structures

Data structures can be defined as an arrangement of collection of data items so that they utilize data efficiently, operations on that data can be done efficiently. Without data structures, there cannot be any application. During the execution of a program, how program will manage dta ainside the main memory and perform the operations that is data structures.

So, let's take an example and explain in detail that how the program utilizes data and how they put data inside the memory. 

Let's observe this diagram :-
Here's our C.P.U. that is central processing unit, can be also called microprocessor. Next is main memory let's say that is RAM. Last is storage, that is hard disk drive or external storage.

**C.P.U.** - It will execute the programs, that is, it is a processor so it will execute the instructions.

**Main Memory** - This is temporary memory or working memeory. It can also be called Primary memory.

**HDD Storage** - This is permanent storage.
